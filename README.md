# ECG-Signal-Processing
Signal processing project
In this project, the primary objective was to call and retrieve EGC samples from a reference site. Following the provided instructions, we obtained a .MAT file containing time-dependent positive and negative peaks. Utilizing the plotATM function or a custom sampling function, we visualized the signal and incorporated additional information. The data was loaded at a 360 Hz sampling frequency and processed using two different filters for noise reduction, effectively enhancing signal clarity. The final section focused on baseline correction, achieved by aligning the signal with the origin. Two different filters were employed for this purpose, demonstrating successful noise removal around the baseline. This concise summary outlines the key steps and outcomes of the project for reference in the readme file.
